# EXECUTION.md

A chronological log of what was done, why, and what surprised me.

## 2026-05-11 — Session 1

**State at start:** repo had only DESIGN.md, PROMPT.md, .gitignore, and a stray
`nixos.qcow2`. No PLAN.md, EXECUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, no Cargo project.

**Done:**
- Wrote initial CLAUDE.md (toolchain via `nix shell nixpkgs#cargo nixpkgs#rustc`).
- Wrote PLAN.md with 16 legs covering DESIGN.md end-to-end.
- Started Leg 1: scaffolded Cargo project with stub subcommands.

**Decisions:**
- No flake yet. `nix shell` invocations are cheap once the store is warm and
  avoid committing to a devshell shape before we know the dep set.
- Stub commands print "not yet implemented" rather than panicking, so
  `tql --help` and the dispatch tree are exercisable from day one.
- Cargo project sits at the repo root (not in a `tql/` subdir) — DESIGN.md
  shows a `tql/` wrapper but the repo itself is `tql`, so we collapse one
  level.

**Notes for future sessions:**
- `nixos.qcow2` (32 MB) sits in the repo root and is .gitignored already (or
  should be). Verify before committing.

**Outcome:**
- `cargo build` is green (clap deps cached at ~26s clean).
- `tql --help` lists all subcommands; `tql doctor` etc. emit
  "not yet implemented" and exit 0.
- Ran build with `nix shell nixpkgs#cargo nixpkgs#rustc nixpkgs#gcc -c cargo build`
  — `gcc` is required as the linker driver; without it `cargo` fails with
  "linker `cc` not found". Worth recording: future cargo invocations should
  include `nixpkgs#gcc` in the shell.
- Updated CLAUDE.md is missing `nixpkgs#gcc`; will fix in this commit.
